# C# Learning

This project is for learning C#, from the beginning.

Because I'm a C++ developer, so I will learn this language by comparing the differences between C# and C++.

## 1. Content

I will implement several examples in this project, including:

- Basic IO
  - `Console.Write` and C++ `std::cout`
  - `Console.WriteLine` and C++ `std::cout + std::endl`
- Data Structure
  - `List<int>` and C++ `std::vector<int>`
  - `Array([])` and C++ `std::array<int, 3>`
  - `Queue\Queue<int>` and C++ `std::queue<int>`
- Memory Management
  - Pass by Ref and C++ `(const Point& p) or (Point& p)`
  - Pass by Value and C++ `(Point p)`
  - Pointer
- Class, Struct, Interface, Record and Enum
- Generic and C++ Template
- Exception Handling

Later, I will add some Unit Test to this project to verify the correctness of the code.
