# C# Learning

This project is for learning C#, from the beginning.

Because I'm a C++ developer, so I will learn this language by comparing the differences between C# and C++.

## 1. Content

I will implement several examples in this project, including:

- Basic IO
- Data Structure
- Memory Management
- Generic and C++ Template
- Exception Handling

Later, I will add some Unit Test to this project to verify the correctness of the code.
