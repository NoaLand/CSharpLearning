# C# Learning

This project is for learning C#, from the beginning.

Because I'm a C++ developer, so I will learn this language by comparing the differences between C# and C++.

## 1. Content

I will implement several examples in this project, including:

- Basic IO
  - Write and C++ std::cout
  - WriteLine and C++ std::cout + std::endl
- Data Structure
  - List and C++ std::vector
  - Array and C++ std::array
  - Queue and C++ std::queue
- Memory Management
  - Pass by Ref and C++ (const Point& p) or (Point& p)
  - Pass by Value and C++ (Point p)
  - Pointer
- Class, Struct, Interface, Record and Enum
- Generic and C++ Template
- Exception Handling

Later, I will add some Unit Test to this project to verify the correctness of the code.
